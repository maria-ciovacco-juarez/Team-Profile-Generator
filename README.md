# The Folklore Bunch -- an Employee Directory

## Description

This is the challenge 10 assignment Object-Oriented Programming in making a Team Profile Generator.

Here you'll find the code and files that you will be able to clone to your local machine and play with yourself. You can change the theme and the styling to your choosing. I chose a folklore theme to make it fun!


## Installation

-- Have a good browser. I recommend Chrome.

-- Clone this repository to your local machine using either Git Bash(Windows) or the Terminal(MacOS).

-- Navigate into the folder with the command `cd Team-Profile-Generator` and hit 'enter'(Windows) or 'return'(MacOS).

-- type and enter `code .` The code should open in VSCode or whatever coding software of your choice.

-- You shouldn't have to install node_modules, but if given any issues you can install them using the integrated command line in VSCode by entering `npm install`.

-- `Inquirer` and `Jest` are already installed, but if you need those installation commands for any reason, they are as follows (and should be entered into the command line):

-- `Inquirer` is `npm i inquirer`.

-- `Jest` is `npm i jest`.


## Usage

-- Make sure all the tests pass first, especially if you're making any edits. In the command line type `npm run test`. If any of them fail you may have to check how the code is written in the corresponding file within the `/lib` directory.

-- When you're ready to create your directory, type `node index.js` in the project root of the terminal to start the prompts. 

-- Fill in the employee information. You may add as many managers, engineers, and interns as you want.

-- When you're done select "The troupe is done!"

-- the new folklore.html file will automatically generate in the `/dist` folder. Pictures of the final version is below. You can also access the demo html with this deployed link.**

**Note that the example html in the project is called `index.html` and is separate from `folklore.html` inside of `/dist `.

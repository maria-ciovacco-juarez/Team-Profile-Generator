# The Folklore Bunch -- an Employee Directory

## Description

This is the challenge 10 assignment Object-Oriented Programming in making a Team Profile Generator.

Here you'll find the code and files that you will be able to clone to your local machine and play with yourself. You can change the theme and the styling to your choosing. I chose a folklore theme to make it fun!


## Installation

-- Clone this repository to your local machine.

-- Navigate into the folder with the command `cd Team-Profile-Generator` and hit enter(Windows) or return(MacOS).

-- type and enter `code .` The code should open in VSCode or whatever coding software of your choice.

-- You shouldn't have to install node_modules, but if given any issues you can install them using the integrated command line in VSCode by entering `npm install`.

-- You will need to install `Inquirer` and `Jest`. 

  -- the command to install `Inquirer` is enter `npm i inquirer`.

  -- Install `jest` by entering `npm i jest`.

## Usage

-- Make sure all the tests pass first, especially if you're making any edits. In the command line type `npm run test`. If any of them fail you may have to check how the code is written in the corresponding file within the `/lib` directory.

-- When ready to create your directory, type `node index.js` in the terminal to start the prompts with `Inquirer`. 

-- Fill in the employee information. You may add as many managers, engineers, and interns as you want.

-- When you're done select "The troupe is done!"

-- the new folklore.html file will automatically generate in the `/dist` folder.
